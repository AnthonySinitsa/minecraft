Automating the Build and Run Process in VS Code

You can also automate the build and run process using tasks in VS Code. You can configure a task to run the build commands and then execute the program, all with a single keyboard shortcut. This can make the development process more seamless, as you won't need to switch to the terminal and navigate directories every time you want to test your code.
